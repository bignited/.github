## What We Do

### 🔹 Test Automation

We partner with teams to evaluate their testing needs, create tailored automation strategies, and implement solutions across:

* Reporting and feedback systems

We are **technology-agnostic**, choosing tools and languages based on the right fit (e.g., Cypress, Playwright, Selenium, Python, JavaScript and more). ([bignited.be][3])

We’ve built our own **Test Data Generator** tool to help testers and automation engineers generate **correct and specific test data**—from UUIDs to national IDs, phone numbers, and more, making data setup easier and more reliable. ([bignited.be][4])

### 🔹 b.strict
